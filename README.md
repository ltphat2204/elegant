## Description

This project focuses on learning Redux Toolkit to store the global state in the app. The mock data and web template are provided by [Academind](https://github.com/academind). The cart for shopping was chosen to be the global state, which can be accessed by any component in the app. As a result, we could easily display items in the cart and get the number of items in the cart.
